# Exponential to Euler's Form Conversion (Octave Function)

This repository contains an educational Octave function that converts expressions of the form **e^(a*x)** into **Euler's formula** representation when applicable.

It is intended as a practical example for beginners who want to learn:
- How to handle user input safely.
- How to structure functions with clear outputs.
- The correct use of `return` statements.

## ✅ How to Run
In Octave:
```matlab
result = exp_to_eulers();
disp(result);

or simply:
```matlab
exp_to_eulers();


## ✅ Files
- `exp_to_eulers.m` → The main function.
- `beginner_code_quality_notes.md` → Detailed notes explaining code structure, input validation, `return` usage, and common beginner mistakes.

## ✅ Why this Example Exists
This small project is designed to help beginners understand:
- Safe function design.
- Defensive programming (default output values).
- When and why to use `sprintf` instead of `printf`.
- Writing clean, reusable code in Octave.
