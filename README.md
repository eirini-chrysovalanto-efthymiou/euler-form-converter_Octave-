A practical Octave example that teaches you the real importance of return in functions, while visualizing Euler's formula step-by-step. Perfect for students.

➡️ The role of return and managing the function's output value
The return statement is used to immediately terminate the execution of the function when the user provides an invalid input. In such cases, there is no point in continuing with the rest of the function's code, as it would lead to errors or incorrect results. By using return, we stop the function at the moment a problem is detected and return control back to the main program.

Regarding the function's return value, it is important to ensure it is always clear and predictable. Even when we know the function will exit early due to invalid input, it is good practice to initialize the function's output variable with a default "empty" value from the very beginning. This prevents potential bugs that could occur if the function tried to exit without providing a result.

If the user provides valid input, the function proceeds as normal. Once all checks are passed, the output variable is reassigned with the correct calculated value. This ensures the program's flow remains safe, clean, and predictable.
